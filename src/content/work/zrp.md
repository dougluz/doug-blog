I actively contributed to the development of products for two fintechs—one focused on remittance sending and receiving, and the other related to invoice anticipation. Being part of agile teams, I had the opportunity to work with technologies such as React, Jest, GraphQL, Node, and Ruby on Rails.

I worked as a front-end developer responsible for the investor platform at Liber Capital. Some key milestones from this experience include:

Active participation in the development and deployment of a discount coupon feature;
Complete redesign of the investor fee upload panel;
Development of POCs to validate and test a white-label platform and a new version of the company's component library;
Mentorship of a junior developer in a learning path covering technologies such as React, Node, Jest, Docker, and Git;
Implementation of improvements in the handoff process;
Creation of React components and integration of React Testing Library for testing.
