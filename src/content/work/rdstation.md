I work at RDSM developing solutions for contact management, including lead segmentation, lead import, lead database, and lead timeline. I work with technologies such as Microfrontends, React, Redux, and Ruby. My main focus is on developing solutions for lead segmentation, including improving developer experience, adding new features, and fixing bugs.
